# CZ2006 Lab- Project 42

Project 42 serves as a one-stop platform for NTU exchange and local students to organize groups for outings in Singapore. It recommends popular destinations within Singapore, and helps users find others who are interested in the same destinations. 

Team 42 envisions a Singapore where foreign exchange students and local students in institutes of higher education can easily be informed of interesting locations in the country and coordinate outings. Project 42 has a core audience comprising of NTU students, and exchange students in particular. The application excavates real-time data from APIs developed by GovTech to make recommendations regarding places to visit in Singapore based on a recommended rating. Users can filter the recommendations feed using filters such as indoor/outdoor, distance, and costs. It allows users to form groups for outings, providing a platform for users to find one another and communicate via instant messaging.
